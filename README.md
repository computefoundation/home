**The Unix Foundation** is an organization providing the foundation of general-purpose computing through solutions in free/libre and open source software founded on the [Unix philosophy](http://www.linfo.org/unix_philosophy.html).
<br><br><br><br>

General-purpose computing is used by all computer users. As a result and as computing is relative to time, one of its most significant matters is efficiency. Today it is almost entirely inefficient however.

General-purpose computing involves concepts such as file management, application windows, database management, file rendering, application development, etc. Solutions in the foundational layer of these concepts are founded on the Unix philosophy and apply to a majority of computer users. Additionally, they are scattered across different resources. General-purpose computing is made efficient with resources dedicated to these solutions and the ultimate goal of The Unix Foundation is to provide them.

# Members

The Unix Foundation currently consists of the following members:

* [Shell](https://github.com/unixfoundation/shell) -  Unix-founded solutions for the GNU/Linux shell
* [Gnu-linux-os](https://github.com/unixfoundation/gnu-linux-os) - Unix-founded documentation for the GNU/Linux operating system

# News

**Android-application-development coming in January. Android-application-development** will be a complete base layer for Android application and applicatoin-server communciation development, removing them for almost any general Android application. This base layer will be a Unix-founded solution for Android system and UI and sever communication components, including user accounts, authentication and application configurations.
