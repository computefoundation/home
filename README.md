The Computing Foundation is an organization conglomerating the foundation of general-purpose computing. It defines this as solutions respecting multiple primitive aspects of an area of computing simultaneously, or, solutions making general-purpose computing easy and efficient.

It's main focus is to create and provide each solution using the best possible approach. This is what the primary work consists of.
