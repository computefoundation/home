**The Unix Foundation** is an organization defining and providing the foundation of computing.
<br><br><br><br>

Every type of computing has a foundation derived from fundamental principles of computing known as the [Unix philosophy](http://www.linfo.org/unix_philosophy.html). A foundation is what computing efficiency depends on and each is easily defined except the foundation of general-purpose computing. Efficiency depends on solutions that respect most of the Unix philosophy as these solutions respect multiple paradigms of multiple respects of a specific type of computing simultaneously. These solutions are easily provided in all types of computing except general-purpose as it consists of almost all respects of computing software. In its context, Unix-founded solutions additionally apply to majorities of GNU/Linux users. The purpose of The Unix Foundation is to provide them.

# Members

The Unix Foundation currently consists of the following members:

* [Shell](https://github.com/unixfoundation/shell) -  Unix-founded solutions for the shell
* [Os](https://github.com/unixfoundation/os) - Unix-founded solutions for the GNU/Linux operating system
* [Applications](https://github.com/unixfoundation/applications) - Unix-founded solutions for applications

# News

**Android-application-development coming in January. Android-application-development** will be a Unix-founded solution for Java server-client communication and general Android application development.
