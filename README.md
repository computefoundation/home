**The Unix Foundation** is an organization of Unix-founded solutions in free/libre and open source software. Its objective is to provide the foundation of general-purpose computing.
<br><br><br><br>

Practically all computing is general-purpose computing. As computing is relative to time, one of the most sought achievements in it is efficiency, however, today it is almost entirely inefficient.

General-purpose computing involves abstract concepts of computing including file management, application windows, databases, file rendering, word processing, etc. Solutions in the foundational layer of these concepts make general-purpose computing efficient and apply to a majority of computer users. This layer is founded on the [Unix philosophy](http://www.linfo.org/unix_philosophy.html). The solutions in are scattered across different resources however. In order to make general-purpose computing efficient, resources dedicated to these solutions must be provided and this is the reason for The Unix Foundation.

# Members

The Unix Foundation currently consists of the following members:

* [Shell](https://github.com/unixfoundation/shell) -  Unix-founded solutions for the GNU/Linux shell
* [Gnu-linux-os](https://github.com/unixfoundation/gnu-linux-os) - Unix-founded solutions for the GNU/Linux operating system

# News

**Android-application-development coming in January. Android-application-development** will be a complete base layer for Android application and server communciation development, removing them for almost any general Android application with a server backend. This base layer will be a Unix-founded solution for Android system and UI and sever communication components, including user accounts, authentication and application configurations.
