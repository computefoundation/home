**The Unix Foundation** is an organization defining the foundation of computing.
<br><br><br><br>

All software has a foundation derived from fundamental principles of computing, collectively known as the [Unix philosophy](http://www.linfo.org/unix_philosophy.html). Each foundation consists of solutions respecting multiple respects of general-purpose computing simultaneously. The purpose of The Unix Foundation is to provide these solutions.

# Members

The Unix Foundation currently consists of the following members:

* [Shell](https://github.com/unixfoundation/shell) -  Unix-founded solutions for the shell
* [Os](https://github.com/unixfoundation/os) - Unix-founded solutions for the GNU/Linux operating system
* [Applications](https://github.com/unixfoundation/applications) - Unix-founded solutions for applications

# News

**Android-application-development coming late January. Android-application-development** will be a Unix-founded solution for Java server-client communication and general Android application development. It will be usable for almost any general Android application requiring or not requiring a foundational REST API for user accounts and/or application-specific server-client components.
