**The Unix Foundation** is home to UNIX-founded solutions in free/libre and open source software. Its objective is to make general-purpose computing and application development efficient by breaking down the barriers in free/libre and open source software.
<br><br><br>

General-purpose computing involves all areas of computing known to an everday computer user or application developer. As a result, efficiency is considerably its most significant concern. General-purpose computing today, however, is enitrely inefficient.

General-purpose software is founded on abstract concepts such as file management, application windows, databases, file rendering, word processing, etc. There exist solutions in the foundational level of these concepts, a level founded on the UNIX philosophy, that either remain unsolved or scattered across different resources. The Unix Foundation was created to house these solutions and provide the foundation of general-purpose computing and application development.

# Members

The Unix Foundation currently consists of the following members:

* [Shell](https://github.com/unixfoundation/shell) -  Unix-founded solutions for the GNU/Linux shell
* [Gnu-linux-os](https://github.com/unixfoundation/gnu-linux-os) - Unix-founded solutions for the GNU/Linux operating system

# News

**Android-application-development coming in January. Android-application-development** will be a complete base layer for Android application and server communciation development, removing them for almost any general Android application with a server backend. This base layer will consist of Android system and UI and sever communication components, including user accounts, authentication and application configurations.
