**The Unix Foundation** is a home to resources of UNIX-founded solutions in free/libre and open source software. Its objective is to make efficient general-purpose computing and application development easy to achieve by breaking down the barriers in free/libre and open source software.
<br><br><br>

General-purpose computing involves all areas of computing known to an everday computer user or application developer. As a result, efficiency is considerably its most significant issue. General-purpose computing today, however, is enitrely inefficient.

General-purpose software is founded on abstract concepts such as file management, application windows, databases, file rendering, word processing, etc. There exist solutions in the foundational level of these concepts, a level founded on the UNIX philosophy, that either remain unsolved or scattered across different resources. As software has architecture and architecture inevitably diverges from this foundational level, general-purpose software does not provide these solutions, making efficient general-purpose computing difficult to achieve. The Unix Foundation was created to provide these solutions.

# Members

Unix-foundation currently consists of the following members:

* [Shell](https://github.com/unix-foundation/shell) -  UNIX-founded solutions for the GNU/Linux shell
* [Gnu-linux](https://github.com/unix-foundation/gnu-linux) - UNIX-founded solutions for the GNU/Linux operating system

# News

**Android-application-development coming in January. Android-application-development** will provide a complete base layer for Android application and server communciation development, removing them for almost any general Android application with a server backend. This base layer will be one large UNIX-founded solution for Android system and UI and sever communication components, including user accounts, authentication and application configurations.
