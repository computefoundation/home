**The Unix Foundation** is an organization defining the foundation of general-purpose computing.
<br><br><br><br>

Computing has a foundation known as the [Unix philosophy](http://www.linfo.org/unix_philosophy.html), or in other words, the fundamental principles of computing. Its efficiency depends on solutions that respect it. These solutions respect multiple paradigms of some respect of computing simultaneously and in the context of general-purpose computing, apply to majorities of GNU/Linux users. As general-purpose computing involves multiple paradigms of almost all respects of computing, its foundation is far more diverse than than all other types of computing, making its efficiency much more difficult to achieve. The ultimate goal of The Unix Foundation is to make general-purpose computing efficient by providing Unix-founded solutions in free/libre and open source software.

# Members

The Unix Foundation currently consists of the following members:

* [Shell](https://github.com/unixfoundation/shell) -  Unix-founded solutions for the shell
* [Os](https://github.com/unixfoundation/os) - Unix-founded solutions for the GNU/Linux operating system
* [Applications](https://github.com/unixfoundation/applications) - Unix-founded solutions for applications

# News

**Android-application-development coming in January. Android-application-development** will be a Unix-founded solution providing the foundational layer for Java server-client communication and general Android application development.
