**The Unix Foundation** is an organization providing Unix-founded resources for multiple respects of general-purpose computing.
<br><br><br><br>

The most significant matter of computing is efficiency. All types of computing have a foundational layer on which higher level layers depend. All types except for general-purpose computing have isolated structures, allowing their efficiency to be achieved much more easily. The foundational layer of computing is the [Unix philosophy](http://www.linfo.org/unix_philosophy.html) *(the fundamental principles of computing)* and all types of computing depend on some part of it to maintain integrity. Only general-purpose computing, however, has complete dependence on it as it involves multiple paradigms in almost all respects of computing. Solutions that respect the Unix philosophy promote efficiency in computing as they respect multiple paradigms of some respect of it simultaneously. As a result, they are foundational to computing and common among multiple majorities of GNU/Linux users. The ultimate goal of The Unix Foundation is to make all respects of general-purpose computing efficient and effortless by providing them.

# Members

The Unix Foundation currently consists of the following members:

* [Shell](https://github.com/unixfoundation/shell) -  Unix-founded solutions for the shell
* [Os](https://github.com/unixfoundation/os) - Unix-founded solutions for the GNU/Linux operating system
* [Applications](https://github.com/unixfoundation/applications) - Unix-founded solutions for applications

# News

**Android-application-development coming in January. Android-application-development** will be a Unix-founded solution providing the foundational layer for Java server-client communication and general Android application development.
