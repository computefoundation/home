Computing has a foundation derived from its fundamental principles collectively known as the [Unix philosophy](http://www.linfo.org/unix_philosophy.html). This foundation is defined by solutions respecting multiple respects of computing. The purpose of The Computing Foundation is to provide these solutions.

# Members

The Computing Foundation currently consists of the following members:

* [General-purpose-computing](https://github.com/computingfoundation/general-purpose-computing) - Shell solutions for the foundation of general-purpose computing
* [Gnu-linux-operating-system-management](https://github.com/computingfoundation/gnu-linux-operating-system-management) - Document solutions for the foundation of GNU/Linux operating system management
* [Application-management](https://github.com/computingfoundation/application-management) - Document solutions for the foundation of application management

# News

**Android-application-development coming February 2nd. Android-application-development** will be a Unix-founded solution for Java server-client communication and general Android application development. It will be usable for almost any general Android application requiring or not requiring a foundational REST API for user accounts and/or application-specific server-client components.
