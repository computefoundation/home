**The Unix Foundation** is an organization promoting the efficiency of general-purpose computing in GNU/Linux through resources dedicated to providing Unix-founded solutions.
<br><br><br>

General-purpose computing is used by all computer users. As a result, one of its most significant matters is efficiency. All computing has a foundational layer and in general-purpose computing it is referred to as the [Unix philosophy](http://www.linfo.org/unix_philosophy.html) *(the fundamental principles of computing)*. The solutions in this layer make general-purpose computing efficient and are constantly developed by GNU/Linux users. The ultimate goal of The Unix Foundation is to make general-purpose computing efficient by providing them.

# Members

The Unix Foundation currently consists of the following members:

* [Shell](https://github.com/unixfoundation/shell) -  Unix-founded solutions for the shell
* [Os](https://github.com/unixfoundation/os) - Unix-founded solutions for the GNU/Linux operating system
* [Applications](https://github.com/unixfoundation/applications) - Unix-founded solutions for applications

# News

**Android-application-development coming in January. Android-application-development** will be a complete base layer for Android application and applicatoin-server communciation development, removing them for almost any general Android application. This base layer will be a Unix-founded solution for Android system and UI and sever communication components, including user accounts, authentication and application configurations.
