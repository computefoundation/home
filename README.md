Computing has a foundation derived from its fundamental principles collectively known as the [Unix philosophy](http://www.linfo.org/unix_philosophy.html). This foundation is defined by solutions respecting multiple respects of computing. The purpose of The Computing Foundation is to provide these solutions.
