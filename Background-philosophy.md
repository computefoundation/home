## Introduction

In 1961, NASA set out on a mission to send a manned rocket to the moon, Apollo 11, however, the calculations were far too complex to do by hand. As a result, NASA designed the Apollo Guidance Computer to do these calculations. In the modern day, a typical smartphone is millions times faster than NASA's computers were in 1969. Considering the math NASA had done with these computers, there should be more software developed today than there is, however, it is difficult as an individual has to spend a significant amount of time learning the architecture of a piece of software to use it. In other words, general-purpose computing today is not efficient because the Unix philosophy is absent in it.

## Main

In the 1970's, before major projects like MySQL, JBoss and Android existed, creators of the Unix operating system *(the root of most operating systems in the world)* believed that software should work together and be easily usable. Today, it is mostly impossible for an individual to develop a major search engine, video game, computational tool or anything in a given amount of time because software is difficult to use. This is because it consists of different paradigms, including aspects of an API, fundamental principles of a programming language or layers of a database project. Furthermore, within these paradigms, software generally does not communicate with other software. In other words, the Unix philosophy is absent in it. Architecture is an inevitable part of software development and a necessary part of application development, however, in theory it does not allow progressive computing. In other words, it has no relation to the Unix philosophy. As a result, it is the biggest threat to computing efficiency. To make general-purpose computing efficient, the Unix philosophy must be applied to it.
